# Full-Stack-Semantic-Styling-02-Challenge
This project refactors an older, `<div>`-heavy travel-blog layout into a clean, semantic HTML5 structure while keeping the original CSS design intact.  
I replaced structural `<div>` elements with meaningful tags like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<aside>`, and `<footer>` to improve accessibility and document hierarchy.  
All images now include descriptive `alt` text, and heading levels follow a logical order (`<h1>` for the hero title, `<h2>` for article and sidebar headings).
