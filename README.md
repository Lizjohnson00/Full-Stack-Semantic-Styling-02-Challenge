# Full-Stack-Semantic-Styling-02-Challenge
This project refactors an older, <div>-heavy travel-blog layout into a clean, semantic HTML5 structure while keeping the original CSS design intact.
I replaced structural <div> elements with meaningful tags like <header>, <nav>, <main>, <section>, <article>, <aside>, and <footer> to improve accessibility and document hierarchy.
All images now include descriptive alt text, and heading levels follow a logical order (<h1> for the hero title, <h2> for article and sidebar headings).
The visual style remains unchanged, but the markup is now modern, readable, and screen-reader-friendly.
